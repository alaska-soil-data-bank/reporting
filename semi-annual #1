From 9/27/22-3/27/23 the project co-PIs (Dr. Nic Jelinski, University of Minnesota; Dr. Colby Brungard, New Mexico State University, and Dr. Sabine Grunwald, University of Florida) along with partners at ABR, Inc (Matt Macander and Sue Ives) began monthly meetings to begin organizing and planning work towards project objectives. These meetings began on October 24th, 2022 and have continued monthly since that time. The project team has organized ourselves around two key platforms - the University of Minnesota GEMS platform which will be utilized for data curation and wrangling, and a team GitHub page where all project activities, meeting minutes, and tasks are stored. We have begun work on objectives 1 and 2 to date.

There are three deliverables as outlined in the project narrative:
1. The Alaska Soil Data Bank (AKSDB). We will acquire, curate, and centralize non-NRCS legacy data for the state of Alaska and stand up a database for continuing contributions on the G.E.M.S. platform of the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. The AKSDB will result in a harmonized dataset for use in digital soil mapping in Alaska and scripts will be written to export the data into a NASIS-readable format for ingestion.

2. AK Statewide Predictive Soil Order/Suborder Map. We will generate digital predictive soil order and soil suborder maps of the state of Alaska at a resolution of 30m.

3. Segmentation Analysis Approach to DSM for Katmai National Park and Preserve. We will utilize a novel landscape segmentation analysis approach to digital soil mapping for Katmai National Park and Preserve.

Data generated by activities outlined in this proposal will be initially stored and maintained in the GEMS platform hosted in the data center of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). MSI performs full off-site backups as part of their disaster recovery plan. GEMS has recurrent Minnesota State Government funding to maintain its core operations, currently with no expiry date. All registered data in GEMS is persistent, given a DataCite DOI minted by our University of Minnesota Libraries partners. In addition to storage in GEMS and linkage in metadata to original data sources whenever possible, harmonized data will be imported into NASIS in compatible, machine- readable format and therefore all data produced by the project will also be imported into NASIS prior to project end. Per the project narrative, the power of the GEMS platform is that datasets are input “as is”, maintaining the data structure of the original authors. GEMS metadata for each dataset includes full reference information. If the dataset is publicly available, the GEMS metadata for that dataset will include information on dataset access, storage platform, and author contact information. This metadata is in JSON format and can be reconfigured and exported for any metadata catalog (in this case specifically targeting the NOTCOM catalog maintained by the NRCS Initial Mapping Team) that may be maintained by NRCS. The GEMS platform excels at utilizing field metadata and fuzzy matching to enable post-input data harmonization. During the dataset input process, in addition to constructing dataset metadata, metadata tags are assigned to each dataset field from a dynamic data dictionary which can be expanded as necessary as more datasets are added. These field metadata tags then become the primary vehicle through which scripts are written to subsequently harmonize the data for export and usage in DSM. There are many advantages to this approach. The primary advantage is that datasets are imported “as is”, meaning that data will match the original data source and author format. This increases transparency because there is no prior “re-working” of data before it is added to the database. As scripts are written to harmonize datasets to a defined format using field metadata tags, these scripts will also be available on GitHub to enable any potential user to recreate the eventual harmonized dataset that is utilized for DSM. Finally, because scripting is used for harmonization, output format is flexible. This is critical, because scripts will be developed to harmonize data and output in a format which can be ingested into NASIS.Each of the deliverables also has a unique GitHub repository nested under the alaska-soil-data-bank organization. 

Notable Accomplishments During This Period (9/27/2022 - 3/27/2023)
- We have completed a working draft of our project metadata which is hosted on GitHub Pages and publicly accessible: https://alaska-soil-data-bank.github.io/project-metadata/
- A GitHub project page has been created to house all project documents, including meeting minutes: https://github.com/alaska-soil-data-bank
- A GEMS Team and Data Workspace has been created to begin data acquisition and wrangling on deliverable 1
- AK Statewide co-variate stack to be used for DSM is being created/curated by Brungard and Macander.
- Geospatial data quality rankings are being developed
